# MoP
Means of Production - A Factorio overhaul mod

Means of Production (MoP) aims to overhaul Factorio by adding a new critical resource to the game. Besides power and ore/materials, you will now require hard, sweaty LABOR for almost every process. Labor is produced by a population which must be continuously fed with enough food and an increasing number of commodities regardless of how efficiently you are using them, introducing a new consumption mechanic to the game to augment or replace how biter defence takes up your resources. Labor represents the input of man-hours into a product and is required for every recipe, including food production, introducing a whole new type of logistical challenge to Factorio gameplay. Population is very restricted, so growing your factorio requires careful thinking to get more and more productivity.

This mod starts in the Stone Age and emulates the progression of human society and technology in real life, however unlike the slow and repetitive vanilla burner stage, MoP kicks off with primitive variants of belts, assemblers, inserters, circuit wires and even construction bots, right from the start. Electricity is not required at all until the mid game. Emphasis is on the productivity increases of specialisation; this means early game recipes are very simple and very ineffective, and (through technology) recipes are gradually unlocked which are vastly more complex, but also many time more efficient, in material, energy and man-hours. From the Stone Age you progressively develop industrialization, mechanisation, robotics and limited AI, each making your population orders of magnitude more productive.

#Should I try this?
MoP is meant for EXPERIENCED players who are looking for a new challenge that goes beyond just adding some new recipes like Krastorio/Angel/Bobs. If you still struggle with those mods you will probably not enjoy this.

# (NOT) Recommended mods
YES
+ Basic QoL mods, Long Reach, squeak through, Picker, mods to run faster, etc
+ LTN
+ bobs adjustable inserters
+ Timetools, in case the early game takes too long for you, though it may trivialize things if you warp through everything at 64x speed so use with caution.

NO
- early bots (not needed)
- stack size increasers, unless it's patched properly (stack sizes are overhauled)
- belt mods, bot mods, train mods except for LTN
- Anything that lets you copy/clone/increase total pop count. Pops are fundamentally meant to be very restricted, anything that violates that will completely unhinge this mod.
- other overhaul mods

#Tips
- Don't enable biters unless you are very sure of what you are doing
- Start Population determines game difficulty to a very large extent. Setting it higher than recommended may eliminate the real challenge. Setting it lower may be outright tedious.
- Handcrafting recipes are available for labor and food and such. Best not to rely on them since it is very tedious, but it may help in an emergency.
- The various types of housing represent your actual living population and thus need to be maintained constantly. It is extremely inefficient to have more villages/appartments than you actually need.
