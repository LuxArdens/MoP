Means of Production - Factorio mod

Means of Production (MoP) is a Factorio overhaul mod that adds agriculture and population. Population must be fed continuously with enough food and increasing number of commodities, to in turn produce the essential item which this mod revolves around: Labor. Labor represents the input of man-hours into a product and is required for every recipe, including food production, introducing a whole new type of logistical challenge to Factorio gameplay. 

The mod starts in the Stone Age and emulates the progression of human society and technology in real life, meaning you will struggle to feed your population for the early game, and won't be able to produce vast quantities of anything until you have a sizable and well-fed population to back it up. Emphasis is on the productivity increases of specialisation; this means early game recipes are very simple and very ineffective, and (through technology) recipes are gradually unlocked which are vastly more complex, but also many time more efficient, in material, energy and man-hours.
