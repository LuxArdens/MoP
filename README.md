# MoP
Means of Production - A Factorio overhaul mod

Means of Production (MoP) aims to overhaul Factorio by adding a new critical resource to the game. Besides power and ore/materials, you will now require hard, sweaty LABOR for almost every process. Labor is produced by a population which must be continuously fed with enough food and an increasing number of commodities regardless of how efficiently you are using them, introducing a new consumption mechanic to the game to augment or replace how biter defence takes up your resources. Labor represents the input of man-hours into a product and is required for every recipe, including food production, introducing a whole new type of logistical challenge to Factorio gameplay. Population is very restricted, so growing your factorio requires careful thinking to get more and more productivity.

This mod starts in the Stone Age and emulates the progression of human society and technology in real life, however unlike the slow and repetitive vanilla burner stage, MoP kicks off with primitive variants of belts, assemblers, inserters, circuit wires and even construction bots, right from the start. Electricity is not required at all until the mid game. Emphasis is on the productivity increases of specialisation; this means early game recipes are very simple and very ineffective, and (through technology) recipes are gradually unlocked which are vastly more complex, but also many time more efficient, in material, energy and man-hours. From the Stone Age you progressively develop industrialization, mechanisation, robotics and limited AI, each making your population orders of magnitude more productive.

#Should I try this?
MoP is meant for EXPERIENCED players who are looking for a new challenge that goes beyond just adding some new recipes like Krastorio/Angel/Bobs. If you still struggle with those mods you will probably not enjoy this.

# (NOT) Recommended mods
YES
+ Basic QoL mods, Long Reach, squeak through, EvenDistribution, Picker, mods to run faster, voidchest, etc
+ LTN
+ bobs adjustable inserters
+ Timetools, in case the early game takes too long for you, though it may trivialize things if you warp through everything at 64x speed so use with caution.

NO
- early bots (not needed)
- stack size increasers, unless it's patched properly (stack sizes are overhauled)
- mods that adjust bots, belts, inserter or trains, or the recipes of these items. Things like LTN are fine.
- Anything that lets you copy/clone/increase total pop count. Pops are fundamentally meant to be very restricted, anything that violates that will completely unhinge this mod.
- other overhaul mods
- Factorissimo, or other mods which add game surfaces outside of Nauvis. These will break the scripts.

#General tips on MoP and its mechanics
Settings and general tips:
- Don't enable biters unless you know what you're doing. Pollution has not been balanced and may never be balanced.
- Starting Population determines game difficulty to a very large extent. Setting it higher than the recommended value may eliminate the real challenge. Setting it lower may result in an experience similar to Seablock.
- Handcrafting recipes are available for basic food and labor and such for emergencies.
- Combinators, splitters and and circuit wires are available from the game start, for free, because your pawns can perform such basic operations. Put this to good use.

Houses:
- Each type of housing has two sides for input of food or other goods, and 2 sides for input of spent labor and output of fresh labor.
- The various types of houses represent your actual living population; they need to be maintained with the required food/supplies CONSTANTLY regardless of whether you use them. It is therefor extremely inefficient to have more villages/appartments than you actually need.
- Housing will not start working instantly the moment you build it. The population living there needs to be fed and given what they demand for some time before they actually start providing labor. Keep it fed and it will come online eventually.
- If you neglect maintenance for your housing or supply it too poorly, the population decends into anarchy and will cease providing labor for you. You will need to provide it with a steady supply of food/commodities for a while again before it comes back online. The time it takes for it to come back online is related to how long you neglected it.
- Some infrastructure and buildings in MoP are handled by your population and thus cost no resource, but may consume labor in their recipe instead. This represents labor locked into tasks such as: hauling items, inserting items, driving trains, etc. They are never permanently lost, as you can get a 100% refund on the labor if you no longer need the relevant items.

Mining:
- Copper is available in its metallic form without smelting. That doesn't make scrounging for it the best choice.
