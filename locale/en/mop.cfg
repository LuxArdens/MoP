human-1=A stasis pods you rescued from your crashed ship. Each stasis pod contain 1 Muman that can be woken up. Mumans eat and sleep a lot and occasionally do something productive. It seems the Wumans all died tragically, so you're stuck with the number you can rescue.
human=A stasis pods you rescued from your crashed ship. Each stasis pod contain 1 Muman that can be woken up. Mumans eat and sleep a lot and occasionally do something productive. It seems the Wumans all died tragically, so you're stuck with the number you can rescue.
labor-1=10 muman-hours worth of hard, unskilled labor.
food-1=It looks appealing\n It covers the basic caloric needs of your mumans.

housing-1=Basic huts. This tribal village can house 100 mumans.
farm-1=A large area designated to trap and hunt alien critters, and forage for edible plants. Comes with some baskets and spears. 10 Mumans can work here.
manufactory-1=A simple hut with some stone tools where your mumans can produce the most elementary products.
coal-mining-1=A primitive and very shallow coal mine. Workers use shovels and pickaxes and endless amounts of backbreaking labor to produce valuable fossil fuels.

road-1=A dirt path. You can have things manually transported along these for free, but it will be at a snail's pace and wastes a lot of labor.
road-2=A basic cobblestone road and some handcarts. Much better than trodding through the mud, but a single person can only pull so much.
road-3=The low rolling resistance of steel rails and addition of horses for power make for much more efficient transportation.
road-4=An asphalt and concrete highway with motorized trucks. A single person can deliver many tons of goods between cities in a single day.
road-5=A giant vacuum tube with magnetic rails that can propel pods containing both Mumans and goods at rocket speeds across cities. It is nearly completely automated and reduces traveling times of Mumans to almost zero.

labor-1=Rest your worker to produce fresh labor
food-1=Foraging for berries and microworms and grouphunting for meat from Tiny Biters. On a lush planet this would be fairly productive, but on this alien rock every day of foraging only barely nets enough calories to survive.
food-1-handcrafted=Gather some food yourself.

farm-1=Designate a spot to hunt and forage.
housing-1=A bunch of simple huts where your hoomans can rest and recuperate. Houses 100.
manufactory-1=Build a crafting hut.
coal-mining-1=A primitive, shallow coal mine. Workers use shovels and pickaxes and endless amounts of backbreaking labor to produce valuable fossil fuels.

deconstruct-road-1=Decommission this dirt path to retrieve the labor currently locked in it.
deconstruct-road-2=Decommission this road to retrieve the labor currently locked in it. We're keeping the cobblestone though.
deconstruct-road-3=Decommission this railway to retrieve the labor currently locked in it. You're not getting your horsecar back though.
deconstruct-road-4=Decommission this highway to retrieve the labor currently locked in it./nDude where's my truck?
deconstruct-road-5=Decommission this magnetic tube to retrieve the labor currently locked in it. The rest of the investment is lost, so be sure this is worth it.
